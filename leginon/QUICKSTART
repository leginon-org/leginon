- edit leginonconfig.py with you default config options

- run start.py  (the developer's interface)
  (this automatically starts manager and launcher on local machine)
  usage:  start.py <session_name>
  if you don't specify session_name, a default will be generated from the
  current date and time

- if you need to connect remote launchers, use "Node Management"
    (launchers must be in leginonconfig.py so they appear on the list)

- now launch nodes and create event bindings as before

- Nodes that are known to work, in a logical order for trying them out:
   EM
   Corrector
   ImViewer

   MatrixCalibrator
