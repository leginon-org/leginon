Notes from Jim:

This was downloaded from:
http://pylab.sourceforge.net/
version 0.6.2

To get it to compile under SuSE 8.2, I had to change the Makefile to have 
the proper locations of the python includes, Numeric includes, and the 
python config files.

I also changed INSTALLDIR to: ..
and changed fftw and rfftw to dfftw and drfftw


To make and install both single and double precision:
	make sfftw
	make sfftw_install
	make fftw
	make fftw_install
