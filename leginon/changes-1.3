Changes since tag version-1-2-0 (cvs diff through focuser.py)

datasync.py
	updates the database for v1.3.  There is also a php script by
	Denis that may be a better way to do it

Navigator Node:
	iterative move correction where user specifies move precision

Acquisition Node:
	can request Navigator to move to targets rather than presets manager
	also may specify move precision, requires application changes with
	new events to navigator

	reference target (christian) - need to figure this out

	no longer internal drift check, only makes requests to drift manager
	this requires application changes with new events

	uses new preset pre exposure, which puts screen down to expose

Presets Manager
	pre exposure

Beam Tilt Calibrator
	some change regarding beam tilt to/from scope?
	rotation center to/from scope

calibrationclient.py
	when stig off, equation is solved without need of A,B
		by "min" is different (higher) in this case

	stage tilt z correction

	different fitting function for mag only stage model updates
	is this working?

	measureStateShift now includes setting of correction channel
		(but not for drift check image)

	measure stage tilt axis location (maybe not in 1.3)

	stage model mag only fit changes

GonModeler
	stage model mag only fit changes

Focuser
	new stage tilt z correction

	diff shows a lot of other stuff

	measure stage tilt axis location (maybe not in 1.3)

	rotation center alignment (or does this go somewhere else)

Corrector
	fixes regarding strange extreme values in images

	clip min/max

	multiple "channels" of reference images.  several nodes will now
	use different channels when acquiring images, but if those extra channels
	do not exist, it will still work with whatever channel is available

Hole Finder
	threshold method option (is this only in JAHC?)

Poly Finder
	Denis working on this

Tomography
	new great stuff!

Target Filter base class
	center target filter, Anchi can describe

RCT
	working on it

Image Assessor
	new utility node

dbdatakeeper
	something about limiting results

Drift Manager
	handles all drift measurement (not in focuser anymore)
	recommended to use 2 correction channels
