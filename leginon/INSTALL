Install the prerequisite software necessary to run Leginon 2 listed on the
download page.

If you are using a Gatan camera on the machine Leginon 2 is being installed copy
pyScope\pythoncom22.dll over the copy python installed (should be
%SystemRoot%\system32\pythoncom22.dll).

Add the pyleginon and pyScope directories to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

Edit leginonconfig.py to customize your environment

Run start.py (this automatically starts manager and launcher on local machine)

You may run launcher.py to additional machines on the network in order to run
nodes on those machines. (i.e. run launcher.py on the machine connected to the
microscope and start.py on a separate machine, freeing the microscope machine
to handle getting and setting microscope parameters and the separate machine to
run everything else.)
