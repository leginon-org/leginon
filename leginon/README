svn checkout myami/trunk to desktop:
   svn co http://ami.scripps.edu/svn/myami/trunk myami-trunk

Create backup folder in c:\python25\Lib\site-packages and move all of these into it:
	ImageViewer
	Leginon
	pyami
	sinedon
	pyScope

For the following packages in myami-trunk:
	imageviewer
	leginon
	pyami
	sinedon
	pyscope
install using python:
	python setup.py install

The following packages should stay in site-packages from previous install:
	numextension
	libCV
	comarray (if you previously had it for a gatan camera)

Since libCV is now libcv it needs a wrapper package.  Create a new folder in
site-packages called "libcv", then create a new file in that folder called
__init__.py with the following line:
	from libCV import *

Run:
	 c:\python25\Lib\site-packages\pyscope\updatecom.py
It's ok if it reports some things not found.
(search bulletin board for updatecom.py if you do not understand the output)

configure the following packages in site-packages according to user manual:
	leginon:
		leginon.cfg
	sinedon:
		sinedon.cfg
	pyscope
		instruments.cfg

If camera size not power of 2 (1024,2048,...etc.), modify pyscope module
to force camera size to power of two:
for example tietz.py or gatan.py.  In function getCameraSize:
	return {'x': 2048, 'y': 2048}
