Steps to install Appion on a CentOS 5 machine

===============================
Pre-install:
===============================

You will need 3 servers:
	* MySQL database
	* Web server
	* PBS processing machines 

Fortunately, all 3 servers can run on the same machine


===============================
Install operating system:
===============================

1. Download ISO disk of CentOS 5 and burn to a blank DVD:
	* ISO file is available at
		http://mirror.centos.org/centos/5/isos/
	* Click on i386 for 32bit machines or x86_64 for 64bit machines
	* Pick a mirror and download 'CentOS-5.2-x86_64-bin-DVD.iso' file

2. Install CentOS 5 with default packages on your machine

3. Install the additional repositories to get additional packages:
	* EPEL
	* RPM Forge
	* RPM Fusion
	* Fedora 6 Extras?

4. You'll need to install a PBS system for job submission, such as TORQUE or 
openPBS. I know Torque comes with Fedora 10.
