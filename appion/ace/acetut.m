%                        Automated CTF Estimation 
%ACE is an automated CTF estimation routine written in MATLAB. MATLAB is a
%high level language of scientific computing and is fairly easy to
%learn. This tutorial would only briefly talk about MATLAB.
%
%                            Getting Started
%
%The main program for ACE is ace.m . Since ace is written in MATLAB,
%like any other MATLAB script the information about a function is given by
%the command 
%
%help function_name 
%
%To edit a function the command is 
%
%edit function_name 
%
%For Leginon users, leginon_ace is the main script. The users needs to 
%edit leginon_ace to make it work for their experiments. Hence, 
%
%edit leginon_ace
% 
%If you dont know what to do next, cry for help!. 
%
%help leginon_ace 
%
%should get you started. leginon_ace calls ace and other functions
%internally. After you have edited leginon_ace, use
%
%leginon_ace 
%
%to run it. Use the help command to get help on any other function. 
%Otherwise, feel free to mail me at spmallick@graphics.ucsd.edu .
