To run the program, type:

# ./ApTiltPicker.py -1 image1.mrc -2 image2.mrc -p tiltpicks.spi

'tiltpicks.spi' is optional.

I left an example in the tiltpicker folder. You must run the program in the tiltpicker folder.

To run the example type:

./runPicker.sh

If all works the picker will open up and you'll have two images of ribosomes.
