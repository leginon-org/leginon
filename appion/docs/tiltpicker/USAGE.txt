To run the program, type:

# ./ApTiltPicker.py -1 image1.mrc -2 image2.mrc -p tiltpicks.spi

'tiltpicks.spi' is optional.

I left an example in the tiltpicker folder. You must run the program in the tiltpicker folder.

To run the example type:

./runPicker.sh

If all works the picker will open up and you'll have two images of ribosomes.

I just made a screen capture video on how to use it. It is available is low resolution on youtube:

or you can download the full screen version from the appion.org website:

I recommend using VLC to watch it:

EXTENED USAGE STEPS:


TiltPicker Usage

    * Start TiltPicker
          o Extract TiltPicker, on command line type:

            tar -zxf tiltpicker-2.0.tgz

          o Go to tiltpicker directory, on command line type:

            cd tiltpicker

          o Display TiltPicker help, on command line type:

            ./ApTiltPicker.py -h

          o Open TiltPicker, on command line type:

            ./ApTiltPicker.py -l data/rawu048b.jpg -r data/rawu049b.jpg -t 50.0

    * Initialize alignment:
          o Maximize window
          o Set correct zoom for images
          o Center the middle bar
          o Pick 5 partcle pairs
          o Save picks to a file
          o Hit the apply button, circles will not match crosses
          o Find theta (tilt angle)
          o Optimize inplane rotations
          o Optimize all parameters
          o Mask region to only look at overlapping regions, overlap is shown on status bar
          o Hit Auto optimize, it performs find theta, optimize angles and mask in a single click
          o If you look at the Terminal it will tell you how many optimization rounds were performed
          o Use transfer picks button, this works but is based on the alignment parameters

    * Auto pick particles
          o Measure particle size using ruler tool, zoom in to get best value
          o Run DoG picker with wrong contrast
          o Reject picks
          o Run DoG picker with correct contrast
          o Show terminal
          o Accept picks
          o Look at DoG map images

    * Clean up particle picks
          o Use clear bad picks button
          o Use polygon tool
          o Auto optimize
          o Use cutoff button to remove picks below a threshold
          o Add more picks
          o Save and quit
