In some cases, this option can actually produce an improvement in classification accuracy. This option scales the particles and references down by a factor of [n] before classification. Since data is often heavily oversampled, and classification is dominated by low resolution terms, this can be both safe, and actually improve classification by \'filtering\' out high resolution noise. Generally shrink=2 is safe and effective especially for early refinement. In cases of extreme oversampling, larger values may be ok.

		'euler2' : '<b>euler2=[oversample factor]</b><br /><i>Experimental</i>, This option should improve convergence and reconstruction quality, but has produced mixed results in the past.

		'perturb' : '<i>Experimental</i>, potentially useful and at worst should be harmless. Has not been well characterized yet.

Is is safest in conjunction with very small angular steps, ie - large numbers of projections.

		'median' : 'When creating class averages, use the median value for each pixel instead of the average.  Not recommended for larger datasets, as it can result in artifacts.  If your dataset is noisy, and has small particles this is recommended',
		'phscls' : 'This option will use signal to noise ratio weighted phase residual as a classification criteria (instead of the default optimized real space variance). Over the last year or so, people working on cylindrical structures (like GroEL), have noticed that \'side views\' of this particle seem to frequently get classified as being tilted 4 or 5 degrees from the side view. While apparently this didn\'t effect the models significantly at the obtained resolution, it is quite irritating. This problem turns out to be due to resolution mismatch between the 3D model and the individual particles. Using phase residual solves this problem, although it\'s unclear if there is any resolution improvement. This option has a slight speed penalty',
		'fscls' : 'An improvement, albeit an experimental one, over phasecls. phasecls ignores Fourier amplitude when making image comparisons. fscls will use a SNR weighted Fourier shell correlation as a similarity criteria.
