These Estimated values are then used to correct each micrograph and particle, simulating reality. In test runs, ACE2 either gets the exact value or completely fails. The latter case is most likely due to the fact that too much noise has been added before estimating.

While apparently this didn\'t effect the models significantly at the obtained resolution, it is quite irritating.
