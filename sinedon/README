To install, run this as root:
	python setup.py install

See examples directory for some examples of how to use sinedon.

Here is a brief introduction:

Config File:
Sinedon can be given default database connection parameters in a config
file called sinedon.cfg which should be in your home directory or in the
current directory where you run your python script from.  See the example
config file: examples/sinedon.cfg.

Defining Python classes that will map to database tables:
You must create a Python module that will map to a MySQL database.
In the module, you will define a class for each table in your database.
These classes must be subclasses of sindedon.Data.  See examples/mydata1.py
and examples/mydata2.py for an example of such a module.

Connecting to the database through Sinedon:
First, the database connection parameters must be configured, either through
a config file as mentioned above, or at runtime using sinedon.setConfig().
For example:  sinedon.setConfig('mymodule', host='myhost', passwd=...)
will create a mapping between the module 'mymodule.py' and the database
given by the connection parameters.
Once the mapping is configured, you can connect as follows:
db = sinedon.getConnection('mymodule')
