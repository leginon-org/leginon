## Comtypes installation

## THIS INSTRUCTION IS FOR comtypes 0.6.2. If you install newer version, this may not work.

### Double click on the installer

### Modify comtypes

IMPORTANT: After installing comtypes, you must make one modification to it. The module "safearray.py" that comes with comtypes must be replaced with a modified version that we provide. You can find the custom version of safearray.py in the pyscope package. Please copy this module from pyscope into the installed comtypes folder: C:\Python2*\Lib\site-packages\comtypes. It should replace the safearray.py that is included in comtypes.

Remove safearray.pyc in C:\Python2*\Lib\site-packages\comtypes\ if it does not appear to recompile (timestamp of the file change) when you import comtype in python command line

    import comtypes

### Run checkcom.py

-   From a command line window:
        cd C:\python27\Lib\site-packages\pyscope
        C:\python27\python.exe checkcom.py

The module it finds depends on the module.
