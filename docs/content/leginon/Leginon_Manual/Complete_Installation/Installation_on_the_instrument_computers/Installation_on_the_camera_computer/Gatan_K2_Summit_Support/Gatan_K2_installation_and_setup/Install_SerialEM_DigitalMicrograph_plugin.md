Thanks to David Mastronarde for providing his DM plug-in using socket connection

## Note: If you have SerialEM installed on the same computer, you don't have to go through this.  The same Plugin can be used by both programs and share the same port

### Remove your older SEMCCDxxxx.dll in  C:\Program File\Gatan\Plugins if you had it from prevous leginon-only installtion

### Download and extract the files

 1. From your browser, go to [[ https://bio3d.colorado.edu/ftp/SerialEM/FrameAlignment/]]
 2. Choose Shrmemframe*..exe for your version of DM to download to your Gatan PC.
 3. Run the downloaded file and follow its instructions.

Add a new environment variable SERIALEMCCD_PORT if not exist already from SerialEM installation. Set the value to an unused port between 50000 and 60000 to avoid conflict with other programs. Avoid ports [used by Leginon](/leginon/Leginon_Manual/Complete_Installation/Network_Configuration/Ports_used_by_Leginon), especially not 55555.

Port 50000 or 50001 usually works.
