INSTALL:
	python setup.py install

TRY IT:
	You can either run client as a stand-alone script that will do all the
processing, or start a server and client will ask server to do processing.
In either case, the client will output the result to stand
	network client/server test:
		start the server with command:  reduxd
		


The idea is to have a server that will read raw MRC files and feed them
to clients who are requesting various operations be done on them:
  binning
	contrast
	FFT
  convert to JPEG, PNG,...

Since, this is a very simple socket server, clients can be written in any
language.  So far I have python and php client examples.

myamiweb is the main client I am thinking of, and hopefully this replaces
php_mrc module.
May be useful for other clients who need image conversions (leginon/appion).

To Do:
	Need an elaborate cache to avoid doing same conversions on same images.
		both in memory and on disk
	server and client config scripts
	security
	have it replace php_mrc (billions of lines of code in myamiweb)
