INTRODUCTION
Redux is a utility for running a pipeline of simple image processing routines.
The main purpose is to produce display worthy images (JPEG, PNG, etc) from
raw MRC images.  It includes a caching mechanism to reduce processing time at
the expence of disk or memory usage.

INSTALL:
prerequisites: python, numpy, scipy, pyfilesystem, pyami, numextension, fftw3 
	Install using "python setup.py install" or just use a local sandbox and just
make sure redux is in your pythonpath

USING IT:
There are two basic ways to use redux.  The first is to use it directly as a
python package.  You import redux and do processing in your python script.
The second is to start a redux server, which can be located elsewhere on your
network.  You then make requests to the server using the client of your choice
(python, php, etc.).

TRY IT:
	Run the stand-alone redux script (bin/redux).  Without any options or
arguments, it will print out a help message.

To Do:
	cache management, clean up old files, etc.
	server and client config scripts
	security
